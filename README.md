## About

The sample lecture repository is an exemplary lecture that can be adopted to build your whole lecture on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Jupyter supports many kernels, most important Python, C++, R, Octave and Matlab. Sample lecture includes 
CI/CD to compile lecture notes (as HTML) and presentation slides (reveal.js) and one day PDF scripts on every change made to the notebooks.
The CI/CD downloads an [React](https://reactjs.org) application called [notebook-classroom](https://github.com/hydrocode-de/notebook-classroom) that will be deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). By adding a little extra configuration, you get an automatically updated classroom application that frees your students from any prerequisite other than an ordinary laptop (or tablet).

The deployed classroom application of this sample lecture can be found at:
